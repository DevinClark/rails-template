# Rails Template

This is a template I use for my new Ruby on Rails 4 applications. **Pull requests are welcome.**

This project is based off of [dennybritz's project](https://github.com/dennybritz/rails_startup_template). I am currently learning Rails so I thought I would make my own.

## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m rails-template/template.rb
```
